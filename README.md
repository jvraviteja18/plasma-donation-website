# Plasma Donation Website
## Desciption:
The world is suffering from COVID 19 crisis, and we don't have any medicine
yet. But there is another scientific way from which we can help to lower the
death ratio or help the COVID 19 affected person. With no approved antiviral
treatment plan for the deadly COVID-19 infection, plasma therapy is an
experimental approach to treat COVID positive patients and help them recover faster,
So inorder to help those people in need, me along with my teammates nageswar and 
harilal have developed a plasma donation website with frontend and database connectivity.
I worked in the team by leading them, also I have created simple HTML files, 
mostly I am involved in the backend development which is a tedious task as a beginner
dealing with lot of errors and bugs. And I was able to nullify those bugs gradually, 
and was able to create a complete working website which was just only hosted locally to test.
Hoping that we could implement the website in the forth coming days.
